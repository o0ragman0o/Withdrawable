# Withdrawable
v0.4.2

A contract API and example implementation to provision point to point pull 
payments from contract to contract or contract to external account using
a *withdraw* paradigm rather than *transfer*.

Ether differs significantly from other value mechanisms such as ERC20 tokens
in that it is intrinsically transferrable between accounts rather than addresses
being registered against tokens existing only in a contract.
While ERC20 offers `transfer()` and `transferFrom()` which have inspired
'wrapped ether' for token like transfers of ether within a contract, the nature
of ether differs enough from tokens for *ether* to warrent a dedicated API
standard for moving money between contracts and addresses to which destinations
and values are internally defined but caller need not be.

Payment channels, for example, might have a single internally defined recipient
so there is no need to permission the caller of `withdrawAll()` so as to
allow any address to call it and move the money to that recipient.  This makes
contract to contract transfers and clearing house operations simpler.

The minimal API defines `withdrawAll()` along with events `Deposit()` and
`Withdrawal()` with all other state variables and functions in the extended API
being optional. 

# Yank
To facilitate economical clearing house transactions, a stateless singleton
contract called `Yank` can be supplied arrays of withdrawable contract addresses
and respective recipient addresses with which to pull money through a chain or
group of contracts to exit addresses.

```

### etherBalanceOf
```
function etherBalanceOf(address _addr) public view returns (uint)
```
Recommended

Returns the balance of ether held in the contract for `_addr`

`_addr` An ethereum address

### withdrawAll
```
function withdrawAll() public returns (bool);
```
Required

Withdraws entire balance of sender to the sender or other internally specified
address.

Returns success boolean

### withdraw
```
function withdraw(uint _value) public returns (bool)
```
Optional

Withdraws a value of ether from the contract. Returns success boolean.

`_value` the value to withdraw

### withdrawTo
```
function withdrawTo(address _to, uint _value) public returns (bool)
```
Optional

Withdraws a value of ether from the contract sending it to a thirdparty address.

`_to` a recipient address

`_value` the value to withdraw

Returns success boolean

### withdrawAllFor
```
function withdrawAllFor(address[] _addrs) public returns (bool)
```
Sends entire balance of the supplied address to the supplied address

`_addr` a holder address in the contract

Returns success boolean
    
### withdrawFor

```
Optional

Sends a value of ether held for an address to that address.

### withdrawAllFrom
```
function withdrawAllFrom(address _kAddr) public returns (bool)

### yank
```
function yank(address[] _kAddrs, address[] _addrs) public returns (bool);

Performs clearing house pull payments across an array of withdrawable contracts by
by calling `withdrawAll()` and `withdrawAllFor()`. Chained contracts should be ordered
furtherest to closest. Any throws in the chain will revert the transaction.
`_kAddrs` and `_addrs` must be of equal length with `_addrs` values being `0x0` where
no recipient address is required. Ether that may have accumulated in the Yank contract
itself is sent to msg.sender at the end of the call.

`_kAddrs[]` An array of withdrawable contracts

`_addrs[]` An array of recipient addresses

### Events
```
event WithdrawnAll(address indexed _kAddr);
```
Logged when a call to WithdrawlAll is made

```
event WithdrawnAllFor(address indexed _kAddr, address indexed _for);
```
Logged when a call to WithdrawAllFor is made

```
event Failed(address indexed _kAddr, address indexed _for);
```
Logged when a withdraw fails and does not revert the transaction.
