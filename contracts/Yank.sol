Yank is a stand-alone and stateless tool to pull a series of `WithdrawAll()`
and `WithdrawAllFor()` payments from Withdrawable contracts. This can pull ether
through a chain of contract addresses to exit address/s

`yank(_kAddrs, _addrs)` is provided two arrays of contract addresses and
recipient addresses of the same length. If a recipient address for an index
is 0x0, Yank will call the WithdrawAll(), else WithdrawAllFor()
